# Pest Control Standalone Peporting Form

Software-as-a-service has become an increasing cost for many local authorities with constant procurements or contract reviews with a view to cut down on expenditure whilst still providing statutory services against a national framework.

Most local authorities don't realise replacing one outsourced solution with another outsourced solution is only a temporary solution. It does not address the root cause.

The solution is simplify the technical stack to enable quick standalone deployment that integrates into other enterprise solutions.

This is being built in public, is provided as an open-source, community maintained alternative for a pest control reporting form/solution.

Features:

- Sign in with custom/standalone authentication, use Microsoft Single Sign On with Dynamics or Salesforce CRM

- Retreive user details from authetnication platform and prepopulate form

- Two way integration for Dynamics 365, Salesforce

- Optionally use our custom CRM to keep everything in one stack
